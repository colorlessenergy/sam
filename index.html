            <p>Dat sammie isn't so great? Are you kidding me? When was the last time you saw a meme with such hilarity and re-usability online? Dat sammie puts the memes in another level, and we will be blessed if we ever see a meme of it's caliber and passion for the memes again. Pepe breaks records. Le toucan breaks records. Dat sammie breaks the rules. You can keep your copypastas. I prefer the MAN</p>
